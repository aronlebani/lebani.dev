           is rare, as a lot of open-source software is extremely flexible),
           you can always modify the source code yourself. There is no end. In
           a world where I constantly feel overwhelmed by how complex things

           more philosophical reasons for doing this.")

           such as colours and aesthetics")

           this a hard pill to swallow. Having an environment that appeals to
           me aesthetically makes me happier, so surely more productive? But
           alas, the Wabi-sabi principle applies specifically to aesthetics.
           There is beauty in inconsistency, in imperfection. Some of my best
           art comes from the tightest of constraints. So maybe I should
           embrace this?")
