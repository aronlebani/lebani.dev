We're right in the thick of winter here in Melbourne. Recently I asked a dear
friend of mine to make a list of 10 things they love about winter, in order to
help stay positive in this dreary time of year. I thought maybe I should make
one of my own, so here it is.

# 10 Things I love about winter

1.  Going for a walk at night after it's been raining. Seeing the glistening of
    all the different coloured lights reflecting off of the water on the
    streets.
2.  Listening to records. The soft crackle of old vinyl breaking the moody
    silence between tracks, for some reason sounds so much better in winter.
3.  The food.
4.  The outfits.
5.  Endless cups of tea.
6.  An excuse to stay at home and read or write or watch a movie.
7.  Rugging up with blankets and scarfes and gloves and sharing music and
    stories around a fire at night time.
8.  The feeling of getting home after a freezing cold walk or bike ride. Slowly
    defrosting when your nose and ears are numb from the cold.
9.  Waking up, making coffee, crawling back into bed to drink your coffee.
1. Moody music while it's pouring with rain outside. Listening to the sound of
    the rain, feeling grateful for being warm and dry, feeling the mood in your
    whole body.
2. That singular moment when the sun comes out from hiding. Feeling the it's
    rays penetrating deep into your body and warming your soul.
